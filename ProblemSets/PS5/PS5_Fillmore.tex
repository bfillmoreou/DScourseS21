\section{SelectorGadget}
For this assignment I used Wikipedia to gather data on Olympic swimming record, by event, name, nation, date, and by the Olympic Games wherein the record occurred. I swam competitively for years, so it's always nice to see where I stacked up against others. The answer being, not well. I used Grant McDermott's githack page as a reference, as well as the SelectorGadget extension.

\section{API}
For this section I used the packages tidytext, rtweet, and dpylr - as well as my Twitter API.
I compiled a dataset of tweets containing the phrase "David Lynch". I didn't include retweets, ultimately I'd probably end up trying to determine positivity, as I've done with Dr. Wang before, to see if folks are typically positive about David, or on the more negative side.
