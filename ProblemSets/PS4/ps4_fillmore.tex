\section{Body}
I would be interested in doing more work using Twitter by hashtag or by region to better understand regional opinion of political figures. I feel that could give some interesting base level insight into preference. My Sparklyr was giving me issue - so I wasn't able to really get into those questions, but hopefully the code is still correct.
