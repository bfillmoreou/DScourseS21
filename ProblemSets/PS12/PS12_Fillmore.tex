I would say logwage is mcar, as there seems to be no consistency between why the data points are missing, and this missing-ness does not seem to carryover into the related rows.  

From these models, the cleaned Heckman model is far and away the most accurate regarding Beta1. I could not include it in my modelsummary(), but I've attached its output below as well.

No, deleting out the relationship between married & kids on our dependent variable would compromise the model, I'd assume
