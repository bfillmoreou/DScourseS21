## Project description ##

The core goal of this project is to run a randomForest model to accurately predict the number of rentals, broken down by hour and day, of bikes in a bike share program instituted in Washington, D.C. This is key for policy implications, as we are able to feasibly understand the demand for bikes in an urban setting. This allows us to move away from a dependence on vehicles and/or public transit, rather opting for a sustainable & green mode of transport. 

## Data Source  ##

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data)

## Code Summary ##

Essentially, you will want to import the data from the given link, replace the filepath assigned variable with your current working directory, and then run the code as it is present. Alternatively, you can use it as a reference and then update the code accordingly, tuning it where necessary. 

Save predictions as a .CSV and export for ease of application and comparison.
